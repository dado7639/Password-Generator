## Password Generator

## Task

For this assignment I was given the task to modify exisiting code in order to generate a random password given a users prefrences. We were given all the HTML needed and very little Java. The website includes a button that when clicked prompts the user to enter desired number of characters in password. It than asks if they want to use uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and or numbers.

## Outcome

I was able to generate a random password. This required the creation of multiple new functions, conditionals, arrays, objects, and a loop. While this was a difficult assignment, working through the code was made easy by writing pseudocode. Before actually writing code, sitting back and looking at whats next and the big picture and planning your next moves makes navigating java much easier.
